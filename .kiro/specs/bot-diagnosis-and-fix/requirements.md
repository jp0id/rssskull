# Bot Diagnosis and Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The RSS Skull Bot is currently running in FEED-ONLY MODE and not functioning as a complete Telegram bot. Users cannot interact with it via commands, and it's not processing or sending RSS feed updates. This spec addresses the complete diagnosis and fix of all bot functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Bot Initialization and Telegram Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the bot to start properly and respond to Telegram commands, so that I can interact with it normally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot starts THEN it SHALL initialize the complete Telegram bot service (not just feed-only mode)
2. WHEN a user sends `/start` to the bot THEN the bot SHALL respond with a welcome message
3. WHEN a user sends `/help` THEN the bot SHALL display all available commands
4. WHEN the bot starts THEN it SHALL log successful initialization of all components
5. IF the bot fails to start THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the failure point

### Requirement 2: RSS Feed Processing and Delivery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the bot to check RSS feeds and send new items to my chat, so that I stay updated with the latest content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RSS feeds are scheduled THEN the bot SHALL check them at appropriate intervals
2. WHEN new RSS items are found THEN the bot SHALL send them to the appropriate chat
3. WHEN rate limiting occurs THEN the bot SHALL handle it gracefully with appropriate delays
4. WHEN a feed fails THEN the bot SHALL retry with exponential backoff
5. IF a feed consistently fails THEN the bot SHALL disable it temporarily and notify users

### Requirement 3: Command Processing and Response

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add, remove, and manage RSS feeds through bot commands, so that I can customize my feed subscriptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends `/add <name> <url>` THEN the bot SHALL validate and add the RSS feed
2. WHEN a user sends `/list` THEN the bot SHALL display all configured feeds for that chat
3. WHEN a user sends `/remove <name>` THEN the bot SHALL remove the specified feed
4. WHEN a user sends `/enable <name>` or `/disable <name>` THEN the bot SHALL toggle the feed status
5. WHEN commands are sent in channels THEN the bot SHALL respond to @mentions properly

### Requirement 4: System Health and Monitoring

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to monitor the bot's health and performance, so that I can ensure it's working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the health endpoint is accessed THEN it SHALL return current system status
2. WHEN components fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
3. WHEN the bot processes feeds THEN it SHALL log statistics about success/failure rates
4. WHEN rate limiting is active THEN it SHALL be visible in logs and health checks
5. IF critical components fail THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic recovery

### Requirement 5: Database and Queue Integration

**User Story:** As a system, I need proper database and job queue integration, so that feed processing works reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot starts THEN it SHALL connect to the database successfully
2. WHEN feeds are added THEN they SHALL be stored in the database
3. WHEN feed checks are scheduled THEN they SHALL be queued properly in Redis
4. WHEN jobs are processed THEN they SHALL update the database with results
5. IF database or Redis fails THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully and retry

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the bot to handle errors gracefully and continue working, so that temporary issues don't break the service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the bot SHALL retry with appropriate delays
2. WHEN Telegram API errors occur THEN the bot SHALL handle them without crashing
3. WHEN database errors occur THEN the bot SHALL attempt reconnection
4. WHEN Redis errors occur THEN the bot SHALL queue operations for retry
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the bot SHALL log them and attempt recovery

### Requirement 7: Configuration and Environment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper configuration management, so that the bot works correctly in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from environment variables
2. WHEN required configuration is missing THEN the bot SHALL fail with clear error messages
3. WHEN the bot runs in production THEN it SHALL use production-appropriate settings
4. WHEN the bot runs in development THEN it SHALL use development-appropriate settings
5. IF configuration changes THEN the bot SHALL apply them without requiring code changes

### Requirement 8: Performance and Rate Limiting

**User Story:** As a system, I need proper rate limiting and performance optimization, so that external services don't block the bot.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing Reddit feeds THEN the bot SHALL use 15-minute intervals and 5-second delays
2. WHEN accessing YouTube feeds THEN the bot SHALL use 10-minute intervals and 2-second delays
3. WHEN accessing other feeds THEN the bot SHALL use 5-minute intervals and 500ms delays
4. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN the bot SHALL increase delays automatically
5. IF feeds are consistently rate-limited THEN the bot SHALL adjust intervals permanently
